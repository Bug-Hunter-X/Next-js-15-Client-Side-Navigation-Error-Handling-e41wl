# Next.js 15 Client-Side Navigation Error Handling

This example demonstrates a common error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications when navigating between pages using client-side routing.  If a page throws an error during rendering, the application might crash silently, or not handle the error gracefully.

## Bug Description
The `about.js` page intentionally throws an error. When navigating to this page using a Link component from the home page, if the user navigates away before the error occurs, it may not be handled properly, potentially leading to an unexpected application state.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper error boundaries and potentially utilizing a loading state to improve the user experience.
